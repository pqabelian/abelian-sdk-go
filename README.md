A Go library that allows developers to interact with the Abelian blockchain.

It provides low-level APIs to interact with the Abelian blockchain including creating keys and addresses, querying blockchain data, decoding privacy-protected data, building transactions, signing transactions and sending transactions.

Please refer to [A Demo Application of the Abelian Go SDK](https://github.com/pqabelian/abelian-sdk-go-demo) for the following topics:

- How to build and run the demo application.
- How to interact with the Abelian blockchain using the demo application only (without the need to write any code).
- How to integrate the SDK into your project and the usage of the SDK.

For high-level APIs, please refer to the [Abelian Java SDK](https://github.com/pqabelian/abelian-sdk-java/) which is built on top of this Go SDK.
